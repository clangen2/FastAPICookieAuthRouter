# FastAPICookieAuthRouter
An outline for router for FastAPI apps that uses cookies to track who is logged in.
I think this works, but have not rigourously tested it yet. This is mainly for use in low stakes things, but if you have improvements they are welcome! 
I suspect there will be some errors with the "Domain" attribute of the cookies in the current configuration; you should make them match your host domain.
